# FlasGist

I'm no longer using FlasGist. Instead, I've designed a similar system called <a href="http://davidwatson.org/zegibl/">ZeGiBl</a> entirely using client-side JavaScript.
A blog based on <a href="http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/">Bootstrap</a>, <a href="http://flask.pocoo.org/">Flask</a>, <a href="http://www.gevent.org/">Gevent</a>, <a href="https://github.com/">Github</a>, <a href="http://www.heroku.com/">Heroku</a>, <a href="http://python.org/">Python</a>, and <a href="http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/index.html">Requests</a>

FlasGist stores its blog data as Gist on Github. The heavy lifting is done via python-requests asynchronously. It uses the Github Gist API to access this data. Right now it uses youtube and flickr embed for the media, but I will convert those to API calls also. Github repositories are listed on the software page via the github API also.

##FlasGist works like this 

###I create a starred gist on github

###I save the starred gist on github; it shows up on github

![github.com: List of Starred Gists](https://github.com/davidthewatson/flasgist/raw/master/screenshots/github-listofstarredgists.png)

###A user hits my blog; flasgist makes an API request, gets the starred gists from github, and displays them

### If the user clicks a specific link, the content for that starred gist is returned from github and rendered as markdown or html

This precludes me from having to implement content management functions such as content creation, editing, updating, and deleting. In addition, I get versioning and forking of content for free - this is beneficial for both annotation of existing content and attribution of content that I did not create, but rather may have extended.

You can see flasgist running at <a href="http://davidwatson.org/">davidwatson.org</a>.
