{"name":"Flasgist","body":"# FlasGist\r\n\r\nA blog based on <a href=\"http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/\">Bootstrap</a>, <a href=\"http://flask.pocoo.org/\">Flask</a>, <a href=\"http://www.gevent.org/\">Gevent</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/\">Github</a>, <a href=\"http://www.heroku.com/\">Heroku</a>, <a href=\"http://python.org/\">Python</a>, and <a href=\"http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/index.html\">Requests</a>\r\n\r\nFlasGist stores its blog data as Gist on Github. The heavy lifting is done via python-requests asynchronously. It uses the Github Gist API to access this data. Right now it uses youtube and flickr embed for the media, but I will convert those to API calls also. Github repositories are listed on the software page via the github API also.\r\n\r\n##FlasGist works like this \r\n\r\n###I create a starred gist on github\r\n\r\n![github.com Specific Starred Gist](https://github.com/davidthewatson/flasgist/raw/master/screenshots/github-specificstarredgist.png)\r\n\r\n###I save the starred gist on github; it shows up on github\r\n\r\n![github.com: List of Starred Gists](https://github.com/davidthewatson/flasgist/raw/master/screenshots/github-listofstarredgists.png)\r\n\r\n###A user hits my blog; flasgist makes an API request, gets the starred gists from github, and displays them\r\n\r\n![davidwatson.org: List of Starred Gists](https://github.com/davidthewatson/flasgist/raw/master/screenshots/davidwatsonorg-listofstarredgists.png)\r\n\r\n### If the user clicks a specific link, the content for that starred gist is returned from github and rendered as markdown or html\r\n\r\n![davidwatson.org: Specific Starred Gist](https://github.com/davidthewatson/flasgist/raw/master/screenshots/davidwatsonorg-specificstarredgist.png)\r\n\r\nThis precludes me from having to implement content management functions such as content creation, editing, updating, and deleting. In addition, I get versioning and forking of content for free - this is beneficial for both annotation of existing content and attribution of content that I did not create, but rather may have extended.\r\n\r\nYou can see flasgist running at <a href=\"http://davidwatson.org/\">davidwatson.org</a>.","tagline":"Flask using Github's gist as blog data store","google":"UA-31053798-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
